This web page will display famous London Landmark - Big Ben Clock. 

Ideas for this project:
The clock to have an option to show the current time in the user's location and optionally the current time in the clock's location - London.
The design to be the Big Ben dial.
The background change depending on the time of day.
The graphics to be created only with CSS (images converted to CSS).
The web page to look nicely in all devices, especially to be used for a desk clock display on a tablet (iPad, Amazon Fire, etc.).
